First, we are going to install and enable IIS (Internet Information Services) which allows our computer to serve up websites such as osTicket. By getting to our IIS we need to type control panel on the bottom left of our Windows search bar. From there click on programs then click on turn Windows features on or off. You should have something similar to the screenshot I provided above. Make sure to check off Internet Information Services, expand IIS, and make sure everything in common HTTP features are checked off so we have no errors, now go to applications development features and check off CGI which is a protocol for web servers to execute programs. Finally, click on the ok button to install everything, and to test it go to a web browser and type in 127.0.0.1 if you see a page about IIS, you are ready for the next steps.

Next, we are going to install PHP Manager for IIS which is a free tool that helps you install, configure, and troubleshoot PHP on IIS. After you get done installing PHP Manager you now have to install Rewrite Module. Rewrite Module is a web server module that allows us to create rules to manipulate URLs so we can make friendly URLs for our users to remember and use. Now create the directory C:\PHP which you can go to your c drive in your file explorer and create a new folder and name it PHP.
